# DSCI-591
This repository is made for DSCI final project
We work on Hapiness report from WHO.

# Dataset
Happiness score or subjective well-being (variable name ladder in our dataset): The survey measure of SWB is from the Dec 22, 2017 release of the Gallup World Poll (GWP), which covers the years from 2005 to 2017. This dataset is compiled from a questionnaire completed in various countries. Questions gauge Happiness, Inequality, Corruption, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy and many more topics. Our goal is to start with basic statistical analysis, make plots of summary statistics and explore relationships among variables. From there we will perform correlation and regression among a few key variables. To get more information, we may group or subset data via split-apply-combine, resulting in more visualizations. In the next phase of our project, after all data wrangling and preparation steps are done, we will build a predictive machine learning model to predict the continent that a country is located based on some values such as happiness, corruption, etc. To do this, we may use Scikit-learn library to examine modules and carry out some classification and assess prediction accuracy. We may develop clustering in Scikit-learn to perform unsupervised learning to create groups of countries based on their data.
